# Unify: Matching Customers with Black Owned Businesses

We are creating an app that provides a centralized platform for customers to find exclusively Black-owned businesses. Business owners will upload their service or product information to the application. Then, customers will be presented with recommendations for services/products. Customersâ€™ profiles will become better aligned with what the customer wants the more they use it, by providing tailored suggestions on the home page.
Like Amazon, customers can rate businesses. Businesses with better customer ratings will appear higher in search results. Owners can also pay to boost their appearance in search results to better promote their business.
